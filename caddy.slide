* Problem Statement
- An older RHEL 6 system with old Apache 2.2 
- Could only do TLS 1.0 want to get to TLS 1.2Ô∏é
- No easy access to new packages for internal reasons
- Didn't want to hand compile Apache and mods and dive into dependency hell

*Requirements*
- HTTP Basic Authentication done with RADIUS using mod_auth_xradius
- Not possible to change authentication protocol

Ignoring the RADIUS module...
We can fix TLS by just upgrading OpenSSL... easy right?

* OpenSSL upgrade....
OpenSSL upgrade via an RPM made things even worse... *Heartbleed*

I tried an RPM for OpenSSL 1.0.1e and it was bad...bad.
 *...lesson* *learned*.

* Options
- Looked for more up to date repos/RPMs
- Tried making my own RPMs from source

*Not* *easy* or fun for a 7 year old operating system without access to fixes

Research led me to *Caddy*
- single statically linked binary (no external dependencies!)
- up to date TLS implementation
- written in *Go*!




* What is Caddy?
Caddy is an open source, HTTP/2-enabled web server written in Go. It uses the Go standard library for its HTTP functionality.

One of Caddy's most notable features is enabling HTTPS by default (Let's Encrypt). It is the first general-purpose web server to do so without requiring extra configuration.

The author, Matt Holt, began developing Caddy in December 2014 and released it in April 2015.

* Ok, so Caddy is awesome... but no RADIUS support üôÅ
- How do we replace *mod_auth_xradius*??

* What is RADIUS?
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A)

Relatively simple protocol
